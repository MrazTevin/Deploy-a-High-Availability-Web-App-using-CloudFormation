## Deployment

```
Running the create script, creates a stack:
./create.sh [Name your Stack] [filename] [file name]

Running the update script, updates the stack:
./update.sh [Name your Stack] [filename] [file name]

Running the delete script, destroys your stack:
./delete.sh [Name your Stack [filename] [file name]

```
